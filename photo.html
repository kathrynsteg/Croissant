        A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent
        shape, which is where they get their name. The dough is layered with
        butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into
        a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a
        layered, flaky texture.
